## Project Question

How can we model the firing of neurons in the visual cortex of a mouse upon recognizing a stimulus using machine learning? 
Furthermore, after the model is finished, will it be responsive to an image despite various orderings of visual patterns or not? (If it is not, we can then prove that the visual cortex likely uses contextual visual information in image recognition instead of an expected "feed-in, feed-out" visual response.

## Project Description

1) Machine Learning Decoder: multiclass classification

Try to predict the letter displayed at a given time and get the computer to do it better and better with more trials!

2) Data Analysis: demonstrative

Set up threshold â†’ if a cell increases beyond a certain point, you take it as strongly responding, so cells might indirectly be strongly responding to stimulus.
