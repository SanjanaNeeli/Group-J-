## Project Question

How can we model the firing of neurons in the visual cortex of a mouse upon recognizing a stimulus using machine learning? 

## Project Description

1) Machine Learning Decoder: multiclass classification

Try to predict the letter displayed at a given time and get the computer to do it better and better with more trials!

2) Data Analysis: demonstrative

Set up threshold â†’ if a cell increases beyond a certain point, you take it as strongly responding, so cells might indirectly be strongly responding to stimulus.
